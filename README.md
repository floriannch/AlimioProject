# Alimio

## About The Project

Alimio is a web application that allows users to search for food products and obtain detailed information about them using the OpenFoodFacts API. This project was created to demonstrate the skills we acquired during our Bachelor's program.

### Features

*   **Product Search**: Find food products by name.
*   **Detailed Information**: View comprehensive data for each product.
*   **Favorites List**: Save products to a personal list of favorites.
*   **Advanced Filtering**: Filter search results by Nutri-Score, allergens, and other criteria.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Java JDK 15 or higher**: Make sure it's correctly installed and added to your system's PATH variable.
*   **Gradle**: The project uses the Gradle wrapper, so a local installation is not strictly required, but it's good to have.

### Installation and Running the Application

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd AlimioProject
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    Use the Gradle wrapper to build and run the project.
    
    On macOS/Linux:
    ```sh
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
    
    On Windows:
    ```sh
    .\gradlew.bat bootRun
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the address provided in the console output (usually `http://localhost:8080`).
